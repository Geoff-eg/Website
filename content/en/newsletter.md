# Newsletter Signup
Although it's never been easier to share images online I have no interesting in learning to play to the algorithms or appeal to the newest trends - I want to focus on getting outside and taking interesting images that I can share with you. That's what my newsletter is for - to be the place you can be the notified of newest posts, blogs, special offers or any other exciting news I have to share!

I can't promise a regular schedule, but what I can promise is that I won't be spamming you either. Expect an email whenever I have something interesting to share.
