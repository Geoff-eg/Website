> Look at the things around you, the immediate world around you. If you are alive, it will mean something to you, and if you care enough about photography, and if you know how to use it, you will want to photograph that meaningness - Paul Strand

This page is ultimately for me so that I may return to the sources that keep me excited and curious about the art of photography.

Like many aspects of life, our choices and appetite stem from conscious and unconscious desires influenced by the never ending stream of information we absorb. It would be remiss not to acknowledge those who have pushed me directly or indirectly to where I am now in my passion for photography. These individuals have without a doubt directed and channeled the noise of creative desire into ideas and desires for my mind to imagine and attempt.
