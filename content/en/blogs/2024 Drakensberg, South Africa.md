### The Great Escarpment
Enclosing the Central Southern African plateau on the far east sides of the Great Escarpment is a region known as the Drakensberg. This region creates the natural land border between Lesotho and South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal Province.

Along with five others, a guide, and three porters I set out on a six day journey covering the North East portion of the Drakensberg Mountains with the intent of capturing this landscape's raw nature.

#### Day 1 - Johannesburg to Witsieshoek Mountain Lodge
Although not a proper day on the trail, it is worth touching on the start of the journey.
A week before starting this leg of the trip, I spent some time exploring Kruger National Park where I met up with the first members of our hiking group, ([Murray Livingston](https://www.murraylivingston.com/), [George Emery](https://www.instagram.com/georgemery/?hl=en), and [Matt Livingston](https://ensofarm.co.uk/)). You can read about that here: ([A Journey into the South African Wilderness](https://www.dyptrephotography.ca/The-Dyptre-Blog/2024-Krugar-South-Africa)) 

With week one in Africa completed, it was back to Johannesburg where we picked up [Brie Stockwell](https://linktr.ee/Creativemindscoach) and [Sean Crawford](https://www.instagram.com/seancrawfordphotography/?hl=en) on our way South to Witsieshoek Mountain Lodge. 
Although primarily a day of travel, this was my most significant exposure to everyday life in South Africa.

The terrain surprisingly reminded me a lot of home; rolling farmland, the infrequent grouping of trees, and a blue sky full of cumulus clouds. That similarity stopped when a herd of water buffalo would appear, an impala was spotted running across the grass, or an Ostrich raised its head. As we neared the Kwazulu-Natal free State the terrain started to change drastically. The rolling hills quickly became steep foothills and the limestone base of the Stormberg region started to show. As we entered the Drakensberg foothills small homesteads and villages made of tin-sheet roofs became more common. We had finally entered an area that resonated with the images I’d grown up seeing of Africa on television.

After driving through the main village of Phuthaditjhaba we finally started our ascent to the base of the ridge line, arriving just in time to unload before our first sunset and our first photos of the trip. After a delicious meal, it was time for a final shuffling of gear, battery checks, a shower, and then it was off to bed.

#### Day 2 - Mont-aux-Source & Tugela Falls
Distance: 7.94km  
Elevation: 555m  
Max Temp: 30°

Our first morning was wild. Waking to thick morning fog, we crammed into the back of a small pickup before driving up a bumpy and rough road to the start of the trail. I look back with laughter, sitting beside George and wondering if I was going to break through the side door or if we would fall unconscious after clashing skulls as we tossed from side to side. At the time, it was less funny and much more dreadful. I am still unsure how our porters and guide arrived in one piece after being crammed into the truck box with our gear. Only as we reached the trail head and broke through the thick fog did we finally see the trail and route we’d be taking up.

We piled out of our rough ride, did a final bag check, and had a quick group shot before starting the hike. We made The locals here use the start of this pathway to reach a viewpoint where we were told they go to practice religion. They do this portion of the hike weekly. That meant buried concrete stones created a solid walking path for our fresh legs to warm up on. We made quick progress on our first few kilometers.

The hike in was one of the most memorable hikes along a ridge line I’ve completed. A vertical cliff towered above us to our left while spine-like ridges carved by water and erosion descended the steep slope down to our right. Lush alpine shrubbery and grassland surrounded the trail and low-hanging clouds created a magical atmosphere for the start of our journey. It became quickly clear why the area was named the Drakensberg; The Dragons Spine.

Of course, I can’t make a blog about this hike without covering the most intimidating section – the chain ladders. Split into two sections, the only way to ascend into the Lesotho Highland is a series of iron chain ladders stretching just over 30m vertically. Even with clear visibility through the clouds, the ladders disappeared into the sky with the illusion of additional height. Our guide stayed at the bottom to yell encouragement as we scaled the ladders and ensured we all made it. It’d be a lie to say there weren’t a few nervous curses coming out of my mouth as I climbed up the ladders. Aside from the first dozen relaxed rungs and a short suspended section midway, scaling them felt secure overall. Though, my brain was screaming at me with horror the entire time. Sean kindly and likely unwillingly provided great comedic relief as he swore his way to the top, providing a much-needed laugh to calm my nerves.

#### Day 3 - Madonna and Her Worshippers
Distance: 15.57km
Elevation: 428m
Max Temp: 36°

The start of our hike was lovely – with the day's heat starting the cloud inversion from our morning view rose and slowly spilled over the escarpment edge, engulfing us in a cool thick fog. It was a sweet relief from the heat of the sun. Although I had packed with the intent of wearing summer attire, I chose to dress conservatively on our first full day of hiking, worried I might ruin my trip by naively risking sunburn. I ended up being very thankful for this decision as some of my companions suffered that night and the following day from burns.

Hiking along the Escarpment my brain immediately jumped to how similar it felt to my hiking experience in the Arctic Coastal plains of Yukon Territories. Due to elevation and temperatures here grass grows in clumps to keep their roots warm while small grooves form in-between the clumps as water goes through freeze and thaw. With the grass obscuring these channels between and the soil having a variety of firmness its quite easy to feel like you’re walking drunk as steps vary and shift: I call them ankle breakers.

With our first massive day out of the way, we pitched at what might be my favourite campsite of the trip. With the stunning and incredible Madonna spires to our East, the location could not have been more exciting for me. Unfortunately, this caused some future pain for me as I barely slept at this campsite. I instead opted to wake part way through the night to attempt some astrophotography.

Per our guide's knowledge, I may be one of the few individuals with a shot of the Milky Way above Madonna and Her Worshippers on the planet. In talking with Alex Nail about this spot later on, he expertly noted that it's only possible with a nighttime cloud inversion to block the large amount of light pollution cast up from the villages below. Our luck on this trip seemed to be endless.

#### Day 4 - Lightning, Rainbows, Mammatus
Distance: 17.31km  
Elevation: 582m
Max Temp: 34°

After shooting the stars two nights in a row I finally slept in. In hindsight, I regret sleeping in, I almost missed one of my favourite sunrises from the trip. As I'd woken with our alarms I watched George jump out of the tent to race down the hill, I took a shot on my phone and rolled over for another 5min. Sometimes listening to your body is more important, thankfully I listened to my intuition and forced myself out moments later, and boy did it pay off!

It was a brutal day for hiking, the day that I finally shifted from Type I to Type II fun and was no longer fully enjoying the experience of baking all day in the sun. I will forever remember this seemingly never-ending hill we had to climb mid-day. As I rested, letting my heart rate settle and the breeze cool me, I'd curse as I looked upwards to the summit feeling like it had gotten further away since I’d stopped walking. All day our guide had baited us with the idea that our camp site was just over the next hill, and a water pool that we could rest and wash in awaited our arrival. We passed endless hills across the tundra like surface as I felt my feet become bruised and sore, and when we finally made it to our final ridge only a sense of apathy towards the remaining distance arrived. Our day didn't end there either, as we neared the bottom of our final accent to where this supposed pool of water existed we learned that another group had already pitched tent in the area we'd hoped to camp. We would have to hike further making this day into our longest and hardest trek.

The efforts paid dividends. As we set camp the air became crisp and cool, and the dark clouds of a storm rolled in. We hunkered into our tent for the intense rain showers, and I stripped of my sweaty hiking gear to relax in the cool air. It was interrupted shortly after with a cry from our guide "rainbow!". Having little time I and the rest of the group hopped out of our tents to an incredible rainbow display.

With the setting sun and moving storm the rainbow persisted for over an hour, allowing us time to redress, hike to the nearby peak, and capture multiple frames of this stunning moment, including multiple frames with not only a Rainbow, but mammatus clouds, and even lighting in some frames. It was likely the most productive hour of photography I've ever had.

#### Day 5 - In Limbo
Distance: 13.77km
Elevation: 562m
Max Temp: 34°

Quiet, Cool, Limbo. These words might best describe the day. Had it not been for the brutal heat of the previous day and exemplary photography of that evening this day may have become a disappointment. However, a day in the clouds became a much enjoyed day of reprieve from the sun for myself.

Instead our day became a beautiful mystery, engulfed in fog that sometimes limited our sight to only a few dozen meters, the hike revealed a different beauty of the escarpment.

As we hiked there would be the occasional ring of sheep bells, the outline of a horse or donkey. Maybe the sight of the Besotho farmers traversing the hillsides before becoming engulfed in the haze again. The outlines of the rocks and plants became a highlight for me to photograph as my mind gravitated to the natural minimalism of the foggy landscape.

#### Day 6 - Thunderstorms and Lighting
Distance: 10.30km
Elevation: 583m
Max Temp: 31°

Our second last day became one of excitement as we climbed to the highest point of our hike. At 3286m we summited the mighty Cleft Peak, a ridgeline peak that for days we had seen approaching.

We'd spent our morning having a beautiful traverse across the ridgeline, pockets of atmosphere washing throughout the valley and over the cliff edges. But as we neared the peak we were hit full on by a passing storm. Our views quickly became obscured as sleet and hail dropped on us, followed by booming sounds of thunder. From a safety perspective, this was the worst time for a storm to pass us. Sitting just shy of the summit of the highest point in the area as lightning illuminated the sky above us. It couldn't have been more than a hundred meters or more above us. I remember sitting there as the rain pelted us, waiting for the storm to pass so I could stand and get my body warm again.

After reaching the summit, we descended through the remaining cloud atmosphere down to our camp. Soaked and cold, I stripped down to try and dry out my clothes, hunkering into the tent to rest and wait out the last of the afternoon storm. I fondly remember playing some Chess with George, and enjoying the warmth of my sleeping bag as the tent protected . A moment of escape to escape from the
