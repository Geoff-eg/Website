# The Fediverse for Photographers

A quick guide to the ins and outs of the Fediverse. What it is, why it matters, and key things you should know before you get started.

## Intro 
You probably read that title and asked yourself "what the hell is the Fediverse?" or maybe you said to yourself "oh no, not another account to signup for" - both reasonable and appropriate thoughts. The good news is that I've written this quick guide on what you ACTUALLY need to know, with a little extra for those that are curious.

## Whats the Fedi-what and why do I care? - The Short Pitch
Imagine you could sign in to Facebook today, like a post your friend made on Twitter right before scrolling down to watch your favourite creators recent video they posted on YouTube - all from the same login! That's the Fediverse. A group of interconnected social medias where it doesn't matter where you login from, all your favourite people are there on your feed, and seeing your feed.

But I already have accounts on YouTube and Instagram, why would I want another? Well, that's the wrong question, the question you should have been asking this whole time was "why should I need a separate login for every single social media?". And the Fediverse is here to fix that. One account to follow anyone you want from any other Fediverse platform style.

## Quick Tips for New Users

If you're not interested in the details and just want to get started, read this part at minimum. Whenever you join a new community there are nuisances and things to know before you charge in to share everything you've got.

### Platforms and Interfaces
Your Platform is the way you will access the fediverse, and there are hundreds of them available. The two most popular for Photographers are Mastodon and PixelFed.

A list of other options can be found nicely put together here. The others I would recommend exploring are PeerTube (Youtube), and FlipBoard (RSS NewsFeed).

The important thing to know about the platform you choose is it's really just the gateway you use to see the fediverse. Your interface and user experience. 


PixelFed is a grid style image focused interface, similar to what old Instagram used to look like. An image is shown, with a 100 character text preview below. A post can include up to 10 images, and 2000 characters of text. 

Mastodon is a feed based interface that includes both text and images, with the text first, followed by the images, there is no preview here, so you see the full content of everything. A post can include up to 4 images, and 500 characters of text.


{{< imageright "Mountains/Alone,_Together.jpg" "Why this matters is personal preference on how you want to explore your content. Platform restrictions do exist because of their setups though. So it is important to understand how your post through a PixelFed instance may show in a Mastodon feed or on Flipboard. For example, if you post 10 images through PixelFed, only the first 4 will show to someone on Mastodon, so make sure those first 4 are the best!" "Company logo design" >}}


And, if you don't like the platform your instance is based on, switch whenever you want. You don't lose your followers or your follows, just the instance changes and login through a different gateway.

### Hashtags

Hashtags are important, not every instance has an algorithm, so hashtags become the primary way to find and share about topics you care about.

The Fediverse has a list of daily theme tags that are used - a way to make a fun game of sharing things. Tags like: 

`#MountainMonday` and `#MonochromeMonday` on Monday's or `#TreeTuesday` and `#TuneTuesday` for Tuesday.

Some of my other favourites to use are:     
`#WaterWednesday`;  
`#WaterfallWednesday`;  
`#ThrowbackThursday`;   
`#FreitagFriday`; and,  
`#ForestFriday`.

There are no rules on these things, and no requirement to participate or follow along. But, a community is created because of how it agrees to participate together, so I encourage you to explore. One of the more important shows of this is `#SilentSunday`. A tag reserved for posting an image with only a title and the tag `#SilentSunday`. If you have more to say, put it in the Alt text, or use the comments to add any other tags or info you want to.

### Alt Text

This will be an important one for those coming from other sites where Alt text doesn't exist.

When you post an image a note for Alt text will show. Alt text is a great way to describe the image shown and provide additional context, and it's extremely important for screen readers.

I'm blessed with good eyesight, but many are not. A screen reader is a tool to help those with difficulty seeing enjoy the same content you do.

Alt text is very important to the Fediverse, and many users will be quick to point out you're missing it. Others take the stance of not liking or boosting a post that doesn't include Alt text in their images.

Here's an example of what your alt text may look like:

### CamelCase
You may have noticed that in the hashtags I noted above all the words were capitalized. This is CamelCase. It's another aid for screen readers and works by telling the screen reader where each word starts. For example: 

landscapephotography -> one word
LandscapePhotography -> two words

This is a great way to use hashtags within a message and keep the message clear for everyone.

### Lists and Filter Lists (Mastodon Specific)

One of the best things about Mastodon specifically is lists.

Have a group of people you want to follow but don't want them showing up in your main feed? Well, in Mastodon you can add them to a List and have them hidden from your main page.

Maybe you want to have a list curated to a specific topic like knitting? Make a knitting list for accounts that post about knitting so you can narrow in on your favorite topic whenever you want to!

I personally find this the best way to view images on Mastodon as well. One of my personal lists for example is called "Inspiration" and features photographers and artists whom I enjoy seeing images from. I go into that list to view only their content when I want to see content from those individuals specifically.

### Filter Lists and Blocking

Filter Lists on the other hand will be your friend when it comes to things you don't want to see.

Maybe there is a certain individual or politician you don't like - use keywords to flag, or completed hide any posts using that word.

Or maybe your feed is getting flooded with a hashtag you don't want to see - add the hashtag to a filter as a temporary way to get relief.

With filters you can set them to completely block, or, provide a contextual warning before showing you the posts.

And, of you come across a particularly nasty or annoying individual, just block them. They'll never know and you'll never have to worry about them again. Problem solved.

## The Long Pitch (this will mostly be a rant)

The Fediverse describes a network of social media sites that can interact with each other using the same open source protocol. Just like no one owns the technology that enables email, no one owns the Fediverse. And that's a good thing. 

In our ever connected world social media continues to play a very important role in how we discuss our world, our problems, and our success. So, why would we hand the controls over to a single company or person? It becomes more obvious each day that the companies that own our social media platforms (Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube etc.) aren't interested in our well being as a community, but only how we as a community can make them more profit. Manipulating algorithms to encourage users to spend money, to favour their political agendas, to compete with each other in absurd-ism, and all for some digital points and clout.

The Fediverse offers a solution. One that is not without its own flaws, but, does give the power back to the people and users. Where you have the choice to own your data, customise your own algorithms, and choose how you participate. How the Fediverse works is better explained by others with more technical knowledge, but the easiest way I can explain it is by comparing it to a house within a city.

## Welcome to your new home

If you're on social media it's probably because you have an itch to connect with others in some way. But, the Fediverse is a new place and it's got new terms that are sometimes confusing. So, here's the easiest way to understand that all. Lets start from the top down.

**The Fediverse - the city**. The broader world of individuals partaking in the social media experience. Its the network that connects us all together.

**The Instance - the neighbourhood**. This is where your data lives and the rules your data adheres to. Sometimes the neighbourhoods are open, and sometimes they're gated, and may dictate rules on how you live there. For example some instances don't allow photos to be posted, some don't allow self promotion, and some don't allow other instances to know they're there! But don't worry, [you can always move to a new neighbourhood](https://joinfediverse.wiki/Moving_instances) if you decide the one you picekd isn't the right fit. Or, you can create a new neighbourhood, [[https://stefanbohacek.com/blog/lessons-learned-from-running-a-single-person-mastodon-instance/#hosting]]

**The Explore/Discover Feed - the street**. This is where the posts from everyone one else on your instance appears.
Pick a main street (a popular instance) and you're going to get a lot of diversity, some people you like, some you'll think are bums, and some people that are going to show you exciting new trends and styles.
Pick a quiet street (a smaller or gated instance) and your home feed will be filled with people more like you. Maybe you pick a street that's only Romanians, or only programmers, or photographers. It's your choice. 

**The Home/Local Feed - your house**. This is where posts from everyone you follow shows up. The people you'll see in passing on a day-to-day when you login to socialise. 

Continuing our neighbourhood analogy, you can invite people from the street or your neighbourhood or your city into your house at anytime. It doesn't matter that they're from a different street or city. Once you've invited them in (followed them) they'll pop in anytime they want - kinda like a vampire.

Your Username - like your passport. A typical username includes two @ symbols and looks like this - @geoff_eg@mastodon.social and it's broken down into @[username]@[instance]. You can also set your display name on some platforms too. Your username you keep forever, but if you change your instance the second part will also change.
