When it comes to Landscape Photography conditions can be everything. It's one thing to plan the location, pay attention to the weather, to get out and climb the mountain, to pack the right gear, and work around life. But, even after all that effort, if the conditions aren't right you can end up with nothing.

But, you get lucky sometimes.

On what was supposed to be a short day hike up a local mountain ended up some of the most productive minutes of photography I've ever had. The plan was to get up early, hike to the summit and be back down just after noon- early enough to get changed and head out for a personnel event. Because it was supposed to be quick I didn't really care about conditions and didn't expect to have much time. But, to add to the exercise and just-in-case I brought my camera. Something I had debated not doing - and boy was I glad I brought it!  
  
What we were greeted with was some of the best conditions I've had on a snowy peak. Soft rolling fog that shift fast with the wind, with warm sunlight pushing through sporadically. Freshly snow covered trees with little icicles.Â   
  
My files EXIF data shows that I took all of these frames within fifteen minutes before our schedule necessitated our descent.
